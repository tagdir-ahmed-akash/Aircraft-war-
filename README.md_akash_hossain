# Aircraft Battle Game

## Overview
This is a simple 2D aircraft battle game written in C++. The player controls a plane and must shoot down enemy planes while avoiding enemy bullets. The game includes health points, collision detection, and a boss level.

## Features
- Player controls with keyboard input (arrow keys to move, space to shoot).
- Enemy planes that move down the screen and shoot at the player.
- Health points for both the player and enemy planes.
- Collision detection for bullets and planes.
- Game over screen when the player loses all health.

## Requirements
- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a compatible C++ compiler.
- **Graphics Library**: This game uses the BGI graphics library. Make sure to set up the graphics library correctly in your development environment.
- **Windows OS**: The code uses Windows-specific libraries (`<windows.h>`).

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install a C++ compiler**: Use an IDE like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio.
2. **Set up the graphics library**:
   - Download the BGI graphics library.
   - Configure the library paths in your project settings.
3. **Compile and run**: Open the project in your IDE, compile the code, and run the executable.

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the player plane up, down, left, or right.
- **Spacebar**: Shoot bullets.
- **ESC**: Exit the game or start the game.

## Game Logic
- The player plane starts at the bottom of the screen.
- Enemy planes randomly spawn at the top and move downwards.
- The player can shoot bullets to destroy enemy planes.
- If the player collides with an enemy plane or bullet, health decreases.
- The game ends when the player's health reaches zero.
